# DontStarve3
作者制作灵感来自于一名新手，当他和这位新手一起玩极限生存。因为对方不杀生，所以不能靠击杀动物的方式获取食物。
The author was inspired by a novice when he played extreme survival with him. Because the other side doesn't kill animals, they can't get food by killing animals.

结果一共玩了3次：   
As a result, I played 3 times:

第一次，这位新手被活生生地饿死了……  
For the first time, the novice was starved to death


第二次，这位新手找到了食物，但是在制作食物的过程中饿死了……         
The second time, the novice found food, but starved to death in the process of making food


于是作者便开发了这款MOD。         
So the author developed this mod.

这些食物能用一些常见的物品/方块获得，不需要再担心饿死的问题!        
These foods can be obtained with some common items / cubes. There is no need to worry about starvation!

如果你是个生存高手，也可以把它当做一个食物类的MOD来改善你的饮食，并且难度比一般的食物向模组简单，极其容易获得食物。  
     If you are a survival expert, you can also use it as a food mod to improve your diet. It is more difficult than the general food module, and it is extremely easy to obtain food.

这是此系列的第三个重置，目前正在测试中。         
This is the third reset in this series, which has been basically completed.
